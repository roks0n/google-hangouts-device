# google-hangouts-device
Chrome extensions that schedule and open and join Google Hangouts automatically.

# Usecase
We show a fancy dashboard on a TV of our office wall which we also use for
stand-ups to connect the team in the office with team members that are no in the
office. This extensions automatically starts and joins a hangout in the office
so the external members can just join in and the stand-up can start as if
everyone were in the office.

# Installation
1. Open `Extensions` in Chrome
2. Tick `Developer mode`
3. Click on `Load unpacked extension....`
4. Select the directory of this extension (eg. `google-hangouts-device`)
5. End Done! :)

# Usage
Hangouts url: input the hangouts url you want to automatically open
Schedule: input time (in HH:mm format! No validation is done!) and tick the
days when you want to open the hangout url
Device mode: Extension will auto-join Google Hangout and presses "I am not
sleeping" from time to time.

# Future features:
- Connect with Google Calendar and start hangouts based on scheduled events
